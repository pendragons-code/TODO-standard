# Example
```
[!] English homework (DUE IN 3 HOURS)
  [/] MCQ page 1-5
  [.] Editing section.
    [-] passage 1
    [%] passage 2 (90% done, I just need to do 2 more questions.)
  [+] Comprehension component, page 10

[.] Math homework algebraic manipulation of quadratic equations. (DUE ON MONDAY)
  [/] Section A
  [.] Section B
    [.] question 3
      [/] 3a part i
      [\] 3a part ii
      [/] 3b part i

        [*] There seems to be an error with the question, (the quadratic equation does not equal to zero in all forms).
    [?] question 4 (The quadratic equation that I tried to solve has resulted in errors in all methods. Be it factorisation, general equation, completing the square and just drawing it on the graph.)
  [+] Section C (Math teacher said we should try to do this, but it is not necessary for completion and submition.)
